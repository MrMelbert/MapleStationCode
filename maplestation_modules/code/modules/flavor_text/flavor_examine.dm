/**
 *	Flavor text and Personal Records On Examine INS AND OUTS (implementation by mrmelbert)
 *	- Admin ghosts, when examining, are given a list of buttons for all the records of a player.
 *		(This can probably be moved to examine_more if it's too annoying)
 *	- When you examine yourself, you will always see your own records and flavor text, no matter what.
 *	- When another person examines you, the following happens:
 *		> If your face is covered (by helmet or mask), they will not see your favor text or records, unless you're wearing your ID.
 *		> If you are wearing another player's ID (In disguise as another active player), they will see the other player's records and flavor instead.
 *		> If you are not wearing another player's ID (if you are unknown, or wearing a non-player's ID), no records or flavor text will show up as if none were set.
 *		> If you do not have any flavor text or records set, nothing special happens. The examine is normal.
 *
 *	- Flavor text is displayed to other players without any pre-requisites. It displays [EXAMINE_FLAVOR_MAX_DISPLAYED] (65 by default) characters before being trimmed.
 *	- Exploitive information is displayed via link to antagonists with the proper flags.
 *
 *	Bonus: If you are not connected to the server and someone examines you...
 *	an AFK timer is shown to the examiner, which displays how long you have been disconnected for.
