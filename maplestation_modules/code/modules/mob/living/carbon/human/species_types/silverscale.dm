		from a customer you never see - and only catch the last name \"Silverscale\" in the receipt.",

		"Of those that HAVE interacted with silverscales (in the brief period they are allowed to) will often remark on just how large their ego is, just how \

		\"noble\" than their tiziran-static counterparts, suggesting some diversity within the silverscale society.",

		worlds. While little hard evidence exists of this fact (with the Tiziran empire itself often refusing to provide information on \"private citizens\"), many a \
		frontier silverscale have referenced the greater society in threats, bargains, and the very, very rare plea.",

		and only traitors to the mysterious \"society\" ever have it removed. It is said to be what gives them their ability to shapeshift into silver statues - how \
