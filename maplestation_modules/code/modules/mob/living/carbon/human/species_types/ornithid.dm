		"Much to the chagrin of the collective, the term \"Ornithid\" is in effect, a dumping ground of the various human-derived avian animalids, making it the second most populous animalid group. \
		Several cultural and geneological groups can fall under this banner, with sometimes only those directly related to eachother baring any resemblance physically.",

		"while countless other groups exist, the three most common ornithid groups known to Nanotrasen are the conniving Izulukin, The wandering Vagrants, and The traditionalist Tengu.",

		"the Izulukin are an infamous bunch, being heavily overrepresented in privateer populations, always hungering for blood and gold. \
		above all else, however, the Izulukin are obsessed with \"Genetic Perfection\", always finding ways to eliminate maladaptive or \"non-beneficial\" genes. \
		this behavior is prevalent in their culture, with many izulukin activating latent genes to given themselves \"Super Powers\" so as to earn an edge in combat, and in culture.",

		"of all the Izulukin's activities, they are most known for their contracts with witches, warlocks, and other dark-mages, binding a living member to a mage, \
		until the bound member perishes, passing on to a chosen descendant should the contract owner perish themself. \
		In addition, another activity they are infamous for is their almost vampiric obsession with the blood of biological organisms, \
		harvesting it to be used in the production of various synthetic proteins, which form the core of their diet.",

		"The third most populous groups are the simply named Vagrants, a typical group of wanderers who have no true home accross the stars, \
		often working as traders, bounty hunters, and other nomadic professions. They are well known for a very effecient style of living, \
		mixing efficient equipment and armor with casual wear, leaving little scraps left to waste.",

		"The most populous of the three groups, the culture of the Tengu bares a striking resemblance to Edo Period Japan on earth, with their primary language, \
		Yangyu, appearing to be based upon Japanese. They have a rigid, class-based society, with one's cultural importance and percieved morality holding more importance than wealth; \
		which unsurprisingly, ends up funneled to the top regardless.",

		"While there are many \"Born\" Tengu, many are cultural immigrants from various portions of the galaxy, most notably those who have fled or been exiled from the Izulukin."
