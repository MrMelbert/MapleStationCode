/* --Tiny Dances And The Everything Tree is based on the abandonded steam game "Prismata". I have attempted
to apply it to the ss13 card subsystem to see how it would work within the game, many of the mechanics have
been moved as best as possible with the main difference of how the cards are obtained being in packs instead
of copies of cards shared between two players. To help alleviate the RNG of cardpacks some cards are given the
{$Mass} tag which means they only need a single copy with a counter of some kind, such as a paper being labeled,
instead of having to hope for getting multiple of one unit. Out of curiosity I have decided to have every card
within a "set" and the different colored "variants" within this. Rarities without a letter before are red, g for
green, b for blue, with m for a mixed set containing green/blue costs and all resource cost units. It is intended
for tdatet_base to contain only 2 cards that are required to play, along with a 28 card booster box of red cards
to help start a game that players with the cardcollector trait will start with. This is an early test with
placeholder card art in the case that I want to rename them or remove altogether if too difficult to keep track of
such as the various build turns or exhausted mechanics. Perhaps if I really wanted to have this be added
to any major codebases I will scrub the Dances name so its not as blatant,
but so far they just reside in the red set. Balancing will be done after a few games, such as rarities.
DEBUG REMINDER Since these are using placeholder art, might want to remove the white square and N from the basic tcg template when finalizing the artwork.

Thank you for testing out our initial prints of Tiny Dances And The Everything Tree!
While the cards are in an early alpha state we wish for you to playtest the various rules and give feedback.

Store all your cards in an easy to grab binder with up to 60 cards instead of a deck. You are able to play any card you can afford.
Set out your Default Dances and Miner Dances cards by counters of some kind (such as a paper) to count how many of that unit you have, you may use counters for any cards labeled Mass.
Both players get 2 Default Dances and 6 Miner Dances, with the 2nd player starting with an additional Miner Dances.
Most units will not be active to defend or attack until the next turn unless the unit's card says otherwise.
A player that has no more units loses, either player may concede as well. If players are unable to add or remove units it is a draw.
Be sure to check on your economy units and have enough cards to support your units. Gold and Green are the only resources that are saved between turns, so you may need a counter for those.
Check out the other color set packs at your local game vendor or order online to expand your strategy with more color resources! Be sure to trade and swap cards to have a good balance.
