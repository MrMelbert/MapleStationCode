Long ago there was a castle of whithering age, which held the only remnants of the people of Gua'nanta. These people with their matted fur and torn scales would pine for the moment unto which they would find refuge, the moment whereupon a hero would come to save what little remained from the painful reign of The Queen of Eternal Slumber. Legends began to form among the hopeful and tired, of a slot machine which would one day select the very hero which they pined for most, who would swoop to their aid in this time of need and destroy the Queen before she could again strike their home with magiks most foul. This is not that slot machine.
